# Labels in Tkinter (GUI Programming)
# The tkinter label widgets can be used to show text or an image to the screen. A label can only display text in a single font. The text can span multiple lines.

# You can put any text in a label and you can have multiple labels in a window (just like any widget can be placed multiple times in a window).


# Example
# A label can be addded with just two lines of code. The first line defines the label and the text. The second line sets the two dimensional position:

"""text = Label(self, text="Just do it")
text.place(x=70,y=90)
You can change the font color or size of the label:

label1 = Label(master, text="Tkinter", fg="red")
label1 = Label(master, text="Helvetica", font=("Helvetica", 18))"""
